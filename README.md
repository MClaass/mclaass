## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

As a frontend developer I have been working on multiple SaaS products. I really enjoy making creative stuff with code. 
Currently I'm working on creating generative art using P5js :D

I have been working with:

- Javascript & Typescript
- CSS, SASS & PostCSS
- Vue, Vue router & Vuex 
- GraphQL & REST API's
- Managing complex frontend applications
- and I dabbled a bit in Go along the way

I really love this talk about the [Art of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U) by Dylan Beattie, and hope to be cool enough someday to create my own programming language ðŸ˜Š
