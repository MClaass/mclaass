            <h1>Graphs visualised </h1>
            <p>
                The inspiration for this project comes from <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">Graphs</a>, a mathematical
                structure in which all elements, known as <b>nodes</b>, are related. Relations are marked with lines
                connecting the nodes, also called <b>edges</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The relationships in this graph are visualised by creating a 50/50 color blend based on the colors of
                the
                connecting the nodes.
            </p>
            <p>
                New nodes will be added to the graph when clicking inside the structure. This will also generate new
                relations based on the adjacent nodes. Clicking on an existing node will remove the node and it's
                relations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever the page gets refreshed, a new graph will be generated using random coordinates for every new
                node.
                A balanced graph is created by limiting the distance between adjacent nodes. This can be adjusted to
                create balanced
                graphs in all sizes.
